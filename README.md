This project introduces Targo, an innovative system designed to optimize agricultural efficiency by integrating advanced sensing and analysis technologies. Targo precisely measures critical soil parameters such as water content, temperature, humidity, and essential mineral levels, including potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus. By leveraging data collected directly from the soil, the system identifies deficiencies and provides realtime feedback to users, enabling prompt corrective actions. 

Moreover, Targo employs advanced algorithms to analyze soil conditions and recommend the most suitable soil types for improvement. It also predicts the most productive fruit or vegetable planting options based on current conditions, empowering farmers to make data-driven decisions. With its focus on enhancing productivity and sustainability, Targo represents a cutting-edge approach to modern agriculture, offering actionable insights to maximize yields while preserving environmental health. 


üìå Introduction
TARGO leverages cutting-edge sensors and algorithms to monitor critical soil and environmental parameters such as:
